JavaScript Arithmetic Lab
---

You know the drill: run the tests (`learn` â€” make sure dependencies are installed (`npm install`)), read the output, fix the code (in `math.js` this time), repeat.

HINT: Make the statements evaluate to `true`.

Again, it's pretty easy to cheat on this lab because we're testing some JavaScript fundamentals. Compare your solution to ours (in the solution branch) and make sure you can explain why your solution works (and why our solution works).

`learn submit` when you're finished.
